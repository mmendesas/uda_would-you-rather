# Would You Rather?

An app that lets you play the famous **'would you rather?'** game.

## What I've learned

- I use a lot of React fundamentals for building all components
- I've tried following a few steps to design my components in the planning stage
- I had a good understanding and practiced a lot in the interactions between react-redux
- I've learned some new things about add items to a structured object using the reducer
